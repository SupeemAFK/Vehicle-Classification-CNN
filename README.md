# Vehicle-Classification-CNN
This project is a Multiclass Image Classification using CNN (convolutional neural network) to identify which vehicle class it is. Vehicle have 4 classes which is Boat, Car, Motorcycles, Plane

# Tools
### 1.) Tensorflow
### 2.) Numpy
### 3.) Matplotlib
### 4.) Opencv
### 5.) Jupyter Notebook

# Models
### 1.) CNN with no tranfer learning
